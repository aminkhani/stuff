# Convention for Writing Title For User Story

A common—and widely recommended—convention is to give each story a **short, consistent “headline”** that reflects the classic user‑story template:

> **As a** `<role>`, **I want** `<action/feature>` **so that** `<benefit/value>`
---
## 🏷️ Title vs. Description

### Title
- A _brief_ summary of the story, usually in the form:
	- **As a [role], I want [feature]**
	- _(The “so that [benefit]” often lives in the description.)_
- Or, if you need extra brevity for backlog views, you can use:
	- **User can `<verb>` `<object>`**
	- e.g. “User can reset password”
### Description
- The _full_ “As a … I want … so that …” statement
- Any supporting details, edge cases, mocks, links, etc.
---
## ✅ Why this convention?

1. **Clarity of “who” and “why”**
    - Puts the user (or persona) front‑and‑center.
2. **Consistency**
    - Every story reads the same way, making planning and slicing easier.
3. **Focus on value**
    - Even if your title omits the “so that…” bit, the description ensures you never lose sight of _why_ you’re building it.

### 🔑 Tips

- **Use present tense** ("User can download report" not "User will download…").
- **Keep titles under ~50 characters** where possible, so they’re easy to scan.
- **Avoid technical jargon**—focus on behavior and outcome.
- **Link to designs or specs** in the description, not the title.

By sticking to this “As a …, I want …” pattern (or its shorthand), your backlog stays both human‑readable and purpose‑driven.
