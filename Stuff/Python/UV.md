### 🧪 What is `uv` in Python?

`uv` is a **fast Python package manager** built as a modern alternative to `pip`. It’s part of the **Astral** toolchain and written in **Rust**, which makes it **significantly faster** and more efficient.

### 🚀 Why use `uv`?

|⚡ Feature|📋 Description|
|---|---|
|🏃‍♂️ **Speed**|Much faster than pip (thanks to Rust).|
|📦 **All-in-One**|Handles **installing**, **locking**, and **resolving** dependencies in one tool.|
|📁 **Simple Caching**|Uses a smarter cache to speed up repeated installs.|
|🔒 **Deterministic**|Locks dependencies like `pip-tools` or `poetry`, ensuring consistent installs.|
|🧪 **Testing by PyPA**|Developed in collaboration with Python Packaging Authority (PyPA).|

### 🛠️ How to use `uv`

#### 1. 🔧 **Install `uv`**

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Or with `cargo` (if you use Rust):

```bash
cargo install uv
```
---
#### 2. 📥 **Install dependencies (like `pip`)**

```bash
uv pip install requests
```
---
#### 3. 📌 **Lock dependencies**

```bash
uv pip compile requirements.in
```
---
#### 4. 📄 **Install from `requirements.txt`**

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
