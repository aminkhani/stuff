## 1. 🧐 Understand the Requirements

### Functional Requirements ⚙️

- **What?** The concrete “must‑haves” your system must do (e.g., “Users can upload images”).
- **Activities:**
    - Stakeholder interviews & user‑story workshops
    - Writing acceptance criteria (“Given … When … Then …”)
- **Artifacts:** User‑story backlog, use‑case diagrams
### Non‑Functional Requirements 🌟

- **Latency ⏱️**
    - Target response times (e.g., "95% of calls <200 ms")
- **Scale 📈**
    - Expected throughput (e.g., “10 k requests/minute”)
- **Availability ☁️**
    - Uptime SLAs (e.g., “99.9% monthly”)
- **Security 🔒**
    - Authentication, encryption, compliance (e.g., GDPR)

> **Tip:** Quantify everything (don’t say “fast”—say “<100 ms”).

## 2. 🚧 Define System Constraints

- **What?** The non‑negotiables that shape your design.
- **Examples:**
    - Budget limits 💰
    - Legacy integration 🔌
    - Deployment platform (on‑prem vs. cloud) ☁️ vs 🏢
- **Why it matters:** Constraints force creative, realistic solutions.
---
## 3. 🏗️ High‑Level Design

- **What?** Sketch the “big blocks” and how they talk.
- **Activities:**
    - Component or container diagrams (C4 model)
    - Define communication (REST, gRPC, message bus)
- **Best Practice:** Keep modules **loosely coupled** & **highly cohesive**.
---
## 4. 🗄️ Database Design

- **What?** Model how you store, query, and evolve data.
- **Activities:**
    - ER diagrams for relational → tables, keys, relationships
    - Schema design for NoSQL → collections, documents, partition keys
    - Indexing & normalization vs. denormalization trade‑offs
- **Pitfall:** Over‑normalizing can kill read performance—denormalize where it counts!
---
## 5. 🚀 Scalability & Performance

- **What?** Ensure your system grows and stays snappy.
- **Strategies:**
    - **Horizontal scaling** (add servers) vs. **vertical scaling** (bigger machines)
    - Caching layers (in‑memory, CDN) 🗄️→⚡
    - Load balancing & auto‑scaling policies
- **Measure:** Benchmark under realistic loads; tune hotspots.
---
## 6. 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Reliability

- **What?** Make your system resilient to failures.
- **Techniques:**
    - Circuit breakers & retries 🔄
    - Data replication & multi‑AZ deployments 🌍
    - Graceful degradation (feature toggles when downstream is down)
- **Goal:** “No single point of failure”—plan for the worst, hope for the best.
---
## 7. 🔒 Security

- **What?** Protect data, users, and infrastructure.
- **Layers:**
    - **Network**: firewalls, VPCs 🌐
    - **App**: input validation, OAuth/JWT auth 🔑
    - **Data**: encryption at rest & in transit 🛡️
- **Checklist:** OWASP Top 10, periodic pen‑tests, secure‑by‑design reviews.
---
## 8. 📊 Monitoring & Observability

- **What?** Know exactly what’s happening, 24/7.
- **Components:**
    - **Metrics**: latency, error rates, throughput
    - **Logs**: structured, centralized (ELK/EFK) 📝
    - **Tracing**: end‑to‑end request flows (Jaeger, Zipkin) 🔍
- **Why?** Rapidly detect, diagnose, and resolve production issues.
---
## 9. 🧩 Tech Stack Decisions

- **What?** Choose languages, frameworks, and tools.
- **Considerations:**
    - Team expertise 👩‍💻👨‍💻
    - Ecosystem maturity (libraries, community support) 📚
    - Licensing & cost ⚖️
- **Tip:** Favor **proven** solutions for core components; experiment in isolated services.
---
## 10. 📝 Summarize & Justify

- **What?** Wrap up your design in a concise document.
- **Contents:**
    - Overview diagram + narrative
    - Key trade‑offs & why you chose them
    - How each decision maps back to requirements & constraints
- **Purpose:** Align stakeholders, onboard new team members, and serve as a reference for future iterations.
